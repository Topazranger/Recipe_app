Implementation
==========================

This section outlines the features developed, implementation issues encountered, and how they were resolved.

Demo Video
------------------
A 3â€“5 minute demo has been recorded showcasing core features:
- User login and registration system
- Pantry interface with add/remove ingredient functionality
- Real-time recipe matching based on pantry contents
- Recipe detail pages (with steps, images, servings, and nutritional info)
- Shopping list and timer components
- Functional timer

Technologies Used
------------------

- **Python (Flask):** for backend server and routing
- **HTML/CSS:** frontend design and structure
- **SQLite + SQLAlchemy:** user management and future persistence
- **Read the Docs + Sphinx:** for documentation
- **Git + GitHub:** for version control

Implementation Challenges & Solutions
----------------------------------------

**1. Environment issues across systems**  
Team members experienced inconsistent setups (e.g. virtualenv path issues). Solved by adding venv to gitignore.

**2. Abandoning scraping for local recipes**  
Web scraping was more complex and time-consuming than expected. Replaced with a curated local JSON file of 15+ recipes including full metadata (ingredients, steps, calories, image links).

**3. Styling the pantry to match the main app**  
Pantry UI lacked integration. Resolved by importing and reusing the main `style.css` and unifying HTML structure.

Lessons Learned
------------------

- Technical scope needs to match time constraints
- Clear division of tasks makes collaboration smoother
- Sometimes simple JSON is better than scraping the entire internet
