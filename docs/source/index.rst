Recipe App Documentation
========================

Welcome to the documentation for the **Recipe App**, a budget-friendly cooking assistant designed to help users discover recipes based on the ingredients they already have at home. This application was developed for the SETaP Software Engineering coursework as a group project.

This documentation includes:

- Implementation notes
- Feature overviews
- Known issues and workarounds
- Team workflow
- Git version control usage
- Testing & lessons learned

The system is built using **Python (Flask)** on the backend and styled with **HTML/CSS**. All documentation is hosted using **Sphinx** and the Read the Docs platform.
